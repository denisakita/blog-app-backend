# Blog App with React, Node.js, and AWS

Welcome to the repository for the Blog App developed with React, Node.js, and deployed on AWS! This README will provide
an overview of the technologies used in this application and how to get started with the project.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: Library for building dynamic UI components.

- **Node.js**: avaScript runtime for server-side scripting and communication.

- **Express**: Framework for creating server-side applications and APIs, handling routing and HTTP requests.

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing flexible JSON-like documents, offering scalability and performance.

- **Firebase Authentication**: Service for secure user authentication, integrating seamlessly with Node.js.

- **Axios**: Library for making HTTP requests between front-end and back-end, simplifying data fetching.

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud computing platform for hosting, storage, and computing, providing scalability,
  reliability, and security.

## Getting Started:

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-app.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:
      ```
      cd blog-app
      cd frontend && npm install
      cd ../backend && npm install
      ```

3. **Set Up Firebase Authentication**:
    - Follow the instructions provided by Firebase to set up authentication for your application. Once set up, make sure
      to update the necessary configurations in your backend code.

4. **Configure MongoDB**:
    - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. Update the
      connection string in the backend code to connect to your MongoDB instance.

5. **Start the Development Servers**:
    - Start the front-end and back-end servers separately:
      ```
      cd frontend && npm start
      ```
      ```
      cd ../backend && npm start
      ```

6. **Open the Application**:
    - Once both servers are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Deployment:

The application can be deployed on AWS using services like EC2, S3, and Elastic Beanstalk. Follow the AWS documentation
for deploying React and Node.js applications to set up your deployment environment.
